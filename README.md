# odin-calculator
The calculator project for The Odin Project.

## Summary
A basic calculator based in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can click buttons or use the Numpad to enter values and perform basic arithmetic.

## Thoughts
* Capturing and covering all the edge cases is tricky.
* Test-driven development would help save time to prevent changes breaking basic functionality.
* I feel like the code is inefficient, but it works (generally).
* My original approach was to capture a whole equation in an Array and calculate it in sequence, but the project requirements were only for two numbers. I had to recode that logic, which was a little painful.

## To-Do
* Apply some CSS styling
* Fully implement a display length limit
